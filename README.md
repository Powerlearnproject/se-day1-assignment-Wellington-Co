#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

1.Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. 
Software engineering is a systematic approach to designing, developing, maintaining, and testing software to ensure it is reliable, efficient, and meets user needs.
     Software engineering is important in the tech industry as it promotes the creation of high-quality software solutions that can scale, improve business processes, enhance productivity, and meet growing technological demands.

2.Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.  
  (i) Structured Programming (1960s-1970s): Introduced structured code that improved 
   readability and maintainability.
  (ii) Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) (1980s): Led to modular design, reusability, 
   and more efficient code management.
  (iii)Agile Methodology (2000s): Brought a flexible, iterative approach that 
    emphasizes collaboration, customer feedback, and rapid adaptation to change.

3.List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
   (i)Requirement Analysis: Understanding the needs and defining the scope.
   (ii)Design: Planning the architecture and technical aspects.
   (iii)Implementation (Coding): Writing the actual code.
   (iv)Testing: Ensuring the software is free of defects.
   (v)Deployment: Releasing the software for use.
   (vi)Maintenance: Ongoing updates and bug fixes.

4.Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
  Waterfall methodology is the  linear approach to software development that follows 
  a sequence of phases where each phase must be completed before the next begins.It 
  is suitable for projects with well-defined requirements that are unlikely to change 
  (e.g., government projects).
  Agile methodology is an iterative and flexible approach to software development 
  that emphasizes collaboration, customer feedback, and adaptability to change. 
  Unlike the linear Waterfall model, Agile divides the development process into 
  small, manageable cycles called sprints or iterations. Each sprint delivers a 
  potentially shippable product increment, allowing for continuous improvement based 
  on stakeholder feedback.It is ideal for projects that need frequent updates and 
  client input (e.g., mobile app development).

5.Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
  (i) The Software Developer is responsible for designing, coding, and implementing 
   software according to project requirements.
  (ii)The QA Engineer is responsible for testing the software,identifying any issues 
   and ensuring the software is reliable, functional, and meets the quality standards 
   before release.
  (iii) The Project Manager oversees the entire project, ensuring it stays on track 
   in terms of scope, timeline, and budget.

6.Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
    Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) are 
    crucial for efficient software development. IDEs like Visual Studio Code and 
    IntelliJ IDEA offer tools for coding, debugging, and testing, streamlining the 
    development process. Version Control Systems such as Git and SVN help teams track 
    changes, collaborate, and manage code versions, enabling smooth teamwork and 
    error recovery. Together, IDEs and VCS enhance productivity, organization, and 
    code quality in development.

7.What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
    Software engineers face challenges such as managing changing requirements, 
    debugging complex issues, and time management. To address changing requirements, 
    adopting Agile methods provides flexibility. For debugging, using debugging tools 
    and conducting code reviews helps identify and resolve issues efficiently. To 
    manage time and meet deadlines, prioritizing tasks, breaking them into manageable 
    steps, and using project management tools ensures better organization and timely 
    delivery.
    
8.Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
   (i)Unit testing focuses on verifying the functionality of individual components or 
     functions within the software. It ensures that each part of the code works as 
     expected in isolation. This type of testing is crucial for identifying bugs 
     early, which reduces the risk of errors in later stages.
   (ii)Integration Testing: Integration testing checks how well different modules or 
     components of the software work together. After unit testing, it ensures that 
     the interaction between various parts functions correctly. This helps identify 
     issues that arise when combining individual components into a larger system.
  
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

1.Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
    Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting prompts to elicit the most 
    relevant and accurate responses from AI models. Effective prompts enhance AI’s 
    ability to deliver precise and relevant outputs, improving the usability and 
    reliability of AI-driven solutions. By guiding the AI to understand the task 
    better, prompt engineering ensures more accurate and contextually appropriate 
    results, making it essential for optimizing AI interactions.

2.Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

  Vague Prompt:Tell me about software
  Improved Prompt:Explain the key principles of software engineering and its role in 
  modern technology

  A vague prompt like “Tell me about software” can lead to broad and unclear 
  responses. An improved prompt, such as “Explain the key principles of software 
  engineering and its role in modern technology,” is more specific and focused. This 
  directs the AI to provide a detailed and relevant response on software 
  engineering,ensuring the output is both accurate and aligned with the user's 
  needs. The improved prompt narrows the scope, making the information more useful 
  and applicable.
